## :bulb: App Evaluation

### Medicine & Workout Tracking 
* **Mobile:** mobile makes it more convenient than website
* **Story:** positive response since it's lifestyle related 
* **Habit:** habit forming because a lot of people go to gym on regular basis and take medicine on regular basis
* **Scope:** should not be too technically tracking


### Plant Tracking
* **Mobile:** more convenient than tracking through a website
    * stores photos of plant for tracking health
* **Story:** useful for reminding to water plants and track plant health
    * good for keeping them alive :) 
* **Habit:** habit forming becaused people will need to check on it often
    * send notifications as a reminder to update log/tracking
* **Scope:** should *hopefully* not be too technically challenging (compared to social media related apps with real-time connections with other users)


### Student Social Media 
* **Mobile:** more convenient than using a website (messaging/connecting with others on the go)
* **Story:** helpful for learning and building connections with others
* **Habit:** habit-forming because you have to stay connected with others 
* **Scope:** might be difficult since we would implement a chat feature into this
    * can probably figure it out, might be a bit challenging 
    * stripped-down version: still cool to build
    * focused around students and their majors

### Movie Recommender / Movie Social 
* **Mobile:** might be better as a website because it's something you might not check constantly
* **Story:** N/A (decided to no longer go with the idea)
* **Habit:** N/A (decided to no longer go with the idea)
* **Scope:** N/A (decided to no longer go with the idea)

### Travel Activities App 
* **Mobile:** could use location to recommend activites on the go
* **Story:** useful for people to see what is going on at the time
* **Habit:** habit-forming because users can check it daily/weekly to find nearby activities in a certain area
    * can have notifications that notifies users of an activity that will happen in a few days
* **Scope:** might be technically challenging but should be able to use what we learned (i.e. using a map API)
    * clear defined (finding activities to do)

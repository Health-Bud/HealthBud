### App Evaluation

[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]

* **Category**: Health & Fitness
* **Mobile:** Mobile makes it more convenient than website
* **Story:** Allows users to keep track of daily their daily medicine intake and/or workout routines. This would receive a positive response since it's lifestyle related. 
* **Habit:** Habit-forming because a lot of people go to gym on regular basis and take medicine on regular basis. Users will regularly log on in order to track down what medications they took/have taken and/or what workouts they have done that day. 
* **Scope:** Should not be too technically tracking since one of the primary features of the application includes tracking down activities (medicine/exercising). 
* **Market:** Anyone that wants to keep track of their lifestyle choices, such as medication/exercising, may use this app.
